        Why do we need to code information during transmission?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        When information is transmitted over a physical medium ‚Äî like air, cables, or wireless networks ‚Äî it's often subject to interference, noise, and signal degradation.
        Without any protection, even a single flipped bit can corrupt the entire message.
        That‚Äôs where error-resilient coding methods like <span class="text-green-500 font-semibold">Gold codes</span> come into play.
        By encoding the original message with specially designed sequences, we can detect and correct many of these distortions, dramatically improving reliability.
        This is especially crucial in systems like GPS, satellite communications, and secure data transfer, where accuracy and integrity are essential.
